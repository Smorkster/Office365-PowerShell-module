# Office365-PowerShell-module

A collection of PowerShell-scripts for administration of Outlook users, rooms/resources, distributiongroups, and administration of Azure-groups and -users.

To make it simpler to use the scripts, they are loaded as a module.

To start the module, run "Starta  PowerShell-Modul.ps1". This will connect to Exchange, MSOnline and AzureAD with MFA. If you have KeePass installed, and the login credentials added as an entry, AutoLÃ¶senord.ahk will automate the login.
